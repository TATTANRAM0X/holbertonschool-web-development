# HTML

HTML is a hypertext markup language, which is used to create web documents, these documents are interpreted by web browsers to display content on screen.

## Creating an HTML page from a wireframe

A wireframe is a simple graphical representation of a web page. To create a web page from a wireframe, first one needs to understand the structure and content that is going to be displayed. Then, the wireframe needs to be coded using the HTML markup language. Tags need to be added for each element within the page, such as headers, body text, images, and other elements. Finally, attributes need to be added to the tags to define properties, such as styles, sizes, location, etc.

## Markup Language

A markup language is a programming language used to tag text. These tags are used to give meaning to the text and to define its structure. The most popular markup languages are HTML and XML.

## DOM

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object programming interface for HTML documents. The DOM is a way to logically and structurally represent HTML documents. The DOM provides an API to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of HTML documents.

## Elements / Tags

An HTML element is a tag that contains content. These tags are used to define the structure of a web page. For example, the `<p>` and `<h1>` tags are used to define paragraphs and headings, respectively.

## Attributes

Attributes are properties of an HTML element. These attributes are used to add additional information to an element or to modify its behavior. For example, the `style` attribute is used to define styles for elements, such as color, size, etc.

## Purpose of HTML tags

Each HTML tag has a different purpose. For example, the `<head>` tag is used to define the header information of a document, while the `<body>` tag is used to define the main content. Other tags are used to add elements such as headers, paragraphs, images, etc.
